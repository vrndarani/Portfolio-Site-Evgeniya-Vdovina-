          <h3>Research</h3>
          <p>We wanted to solve the problem of people having immediate access
            to verified experts in various fields by building an app where users
            can quickly find, call and text experts in the required field.
            After realizing the scope of the app, we moved on to competitive analysis that highlighted
            some market opportunities for us. As the users of expert apps tend
            to be younger ones, they can be reached by larger efforts in marketing,
            especially SMM on Instagram and TikTok. Another thing we discovered
            is there is no app that provides both top verified experts and
            immediate access to them. With that in mind, we deciced to
            introduce online/offline presence and rating system that also
            includes experts’ availability. We conducted potential user
            interviews and collected their needs and goals that proved
            our problem statement to be correct. </p>

          <h3>Ideation</h3>
          <p>We created a user persona to give a face to our users’ needs and goals,
            analyses their task flow and designed their user flow. This helped us see what
            must be included in the app and eventually build a sitemap with the right hierarchy. </p>

          <h3>Wireframe</h3>
          <p>These low-fidelity wireframes are meant to organize the information on
            each screen of the app for further design process: mid- and high- levels of
            fidelity and prototyping. </p>

          <h3>Design</h3>
          <p>With several rounds of iterations based on user testing and peers’
            feedback, we created this high-fidelity wireframes that are to be used
            in prototyping. In the process we focused on providing all the necessary information and avoiding clutter. We added online status to experts, changed buttons locations, using the feedback from user testing and our observations. </p>

          <h3>Prototyping</h3>
          <p>After 3 rounds of user testing, 2 rounds of A/B testing, we made
            iterations and finalized the prototype (although no project can be
            final and there is room for improvement here as well). We worked on
            final frictions and tried to improve accessibility with color choices
            and grouping.
            <br>
            The prototype we created can be found

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>The fascinating discoveries we made at research stage - of how people
            act and what they need when looking for help - allowed us to create
            an app that smoothly and easily brings the user to their goal: to
            quickly find the right expert, connect with them right away -
            through calls or messages.
